## Data Exploration & Wrangling

What does the data frame look like:

```{r}
head(winter23)
```

Data Types for each column:

```{r}
str(winter23)
```

Converting Registration Date to Date data type:

```{r}
winter23$`Registration Date` <- as.Date(winter23$`Registration Date`)

winter23$`Account Deactivated`<- as.factor(winter23$`Account Deactivated`)

sum(is.na(winter23$`Registration Date`)) 
sum(is.na(winter23$`Account Deactivated`)) 

```

```{r}
